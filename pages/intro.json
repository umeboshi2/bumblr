{"content": "# [Bumblr](#)\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is messing around.\n\nCurrently, all that is supported is simple operations that only require \na consumer key.  The consumer key for bumblr is provided by convenience,\nbut it is not integrated into the application, providing for a user to\nobtain their own api keys, and other necessary tokens, to be able to use \nthis site with their own credentials.  The consumer key, as well as the \nother credentials are stored in the Local Storage portion of your web \nbrowser.  Credentials, including the consumer_key, are never seen by the \nserver serving these pages.\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can see a demo [here](#bumblr)\n\n## GitHub Pages\n\nHow I create this [website](http://umeboshi2.github.io/#pages/github-pages)\n\n## todo\n\nfailure callbacks are necessary\n", "id": "intro"}
