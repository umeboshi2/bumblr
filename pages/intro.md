# [Bumblr](#)


## Introduction

This is messing around.

Currently, all that is supported is simple operations that only require 
a consumer key.  The consumer key for bumblr is provided by convenience,
but it is not integrated into the application, providing for a user to
obtain their own api keys, and other necessary tokens, to be able to use 
this site with their own credentials.  The consumer key, as well as the 
other credentials are stored in the Local Storage portion of your web 
browser.  Credentials, including the consumer_key, are never seen by the 
server serving these pages.
